# C# Fundamentals Topics

## Introduction

Let's recap C# Fundamentals, but instead of going through dozens of slides, we will learn in a more collaborative way. Everybody picks a topic from the following list. Next, you research your topic on the internet. Tip: [Microsoft's C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) might be particularly useful. Come up with a short piece of sample code for your topic and record a video on [Flipgrid](https://flipgrid.com/de4b3d38) (max. three minutes) in which you describe your topic to your fellow students based on the sample code. Don't use slides, just the code, and your voice. I have attached a sample clip to the Flipgrid topic about the new C# feature [Top-Level Statements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-9.0/top-level-statements).

The topics are structured in levels.

* Level 1 topics are pretty basic topics, you shouldn't have problems describing them.
* Level 2 topics are more complex. They are not particularly hard to understand, but it is challenging to describe an interesting aspect of them in a short video.
* Level 3 is for the pros. These concepts are harder to comprehend and you will have to be creative to boil them down into such a short video.

**Note**: Don't try to cover every aspect of your topic. If it is too broad for a shot video, pick one or two interesting aspects and focus on that. Demonstrate courage to leave a gap instead of packing too much content into your video.

## Picking a Topic

Put your name right next to the topic you want to cover in your video. You do not know how because you are not familiar with GitHub yet? [Watch a video I created for you describing the process of contributing changes to my GitHub repository](https://youtu.be/mBprBD16P3g).

## Development Environment

You can choose in which environment you would like to do your demo. *Visual Studio 2019* is recommended, *Visual Studio Code* is also fine. However, you can also consider online tools like:

* [repl.it](https://repl.it/)
* [sharplab.io](https://sharplab.io/)
